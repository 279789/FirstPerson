# A Simple Raycaster in CopperSpice

## Introduction

This project was primay writen for the exam of the Lecture : Object Orientierte Programmierung from Stephan Bökelmann at THGA.

The project contains a cpp program that demenstrates how a simple RaycasterEngine Operates.
The most well known Computergame that used a Raycasterengine is WolfenStein 3D which Released in 1992.

How ever this gameengine is not truely a 3d Engine. It's more an 2D Game where Walls are drawn Vertically,
so that the View of the Player looks 3D Like.

Due to time constraints, this Version only renders walls, floor and feeling in the most simple way.
How ever, I plan to implement Textures, Sprites and Enemies in the Future.

The Current version of this Raycaster is very "demo only", so feel free to add or improve this Code.
